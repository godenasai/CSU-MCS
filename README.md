# CSU-MCS

An iOS application which helps to connect alumni and current students. Also, it helps to view campus updates and posts that the user follows. The complete application was developed without using any external APIs or SDKs other than Parse.

Key features:

Follow users(Professors, Alumni) to know about course updates.
Users can have a private conversation with others.
Groups can be created for each class and add users into it.

Development details:

The project is completely developed with the latest programming language Swift 2.0 and Parse. The Parse database has been migrated to the lasest open source Parse server with Heroku and MongoDB. 

Auto layout:
The application works in any iPhone size with potrait and landscape mode. In order to accomplish this I made use of Autolayout concepts using stack views. 

UI and UX design:
All the icons used in the app were created using Sketch3.
